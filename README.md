# JavaScript Workouts

## Overview
This repository contains a full set of JavaScript exercises for learning and practice. Below are the topics covered.

## Topics

### 1. **Data Types**
- Learn and practice primitive types (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol) and complex types (Object, Array, Function).
- Example exercises: Declare variables of each type, check their types using `typeof`, and perform operations on them.

### 2. **Variables**
- Focus on `var`, `let`, and `const`—their differences and scoping rules.
- Example exercise: Practice variable declaration, re-assignment, and scope visibility within different code blocks.

### 3. **Functions**
- Learn function declaration, expression, and arrow functions.
- Example exercise: Write functions to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, and string manipulation.

### 4. **Arrays**
- Understand array creation, indexing, and methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, and `map()`.
- Example exercise: Write functions to manipulate arrays, like reversing an array or filtering even numbers.

### 5. **Objects**
- Learn about object creation, properties, methods, and the `this` keyword.
- Example exercise: Create an object representing a car with properties like `make`, `model`, and `year`, then create methods to display the car’s information.

### 6. **Types of Functions**
- Study **regular functions**, **anonymous functions**, **arrow functions**, **IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), and **callback functions**.
- Example exercise: Write an IIFE and compare it with regular function declarations.

### 7. **Currying Function**
- Learn what currying is and how it allows you to break down functions into smaller, reusable pieces.
- Example exercise: Implement a curried function that adds multiple numbers together.

### 8. **Control Flow Statements**
- Understand the usage of **if**, **else**, **switch**, and **ternary operators** for controlling program flow.
- Example exercise: Write a program to determine if a number is even or odd, and another to classify a number as positive, negative, or zero.

### 9. **Loops and If Conditions**
- Practice with loops like **for**, **while**, and **do-while**. Combine them with conditional statements.
- Example exercise: Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100, and uses a `for` loop with `if` conditions to check for divisibility by 3 or 5.

### 10. **Regular Expressions**
- Learn about regex syntax for pattern matching (e.g., `\d` for digits, `\w` for word characters).
- Example exercise: Write a regex to validate an email address or a phone number format.

### 11. **Exception Error Handling**
- Understand `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks for handling errors.
- Example exercise: Write a function that divides two numbers and catches division by zero errors.

### 12. **jQuery Read Me File in GitHub**
- If you're working on jQuery, ensure you have a README that includes installation instructions, basic usage examples, and any dependencies.
- Example exercise: Create a jQuery function that manipulates the DOM, like changing text or hiding/showing elements.
